## What is DevPanic?

I love helping people learn and providing others with guidance and resources that are more positive and encouraging than scoffing at their lack of knowledge. Being a Junior Developer, I know all too well the crushing pressure of Impostor Syndrome, the frustration of not knowing how to get the magic on your side, the terror of getting something working and having no idea why,or worse yet, knowing what needs to happen and having no idea how.

I wanted DevPanic to be a a very basic application for sourcing resources, at minimum encouraging words for developers when they're hitting their breaking points--a common occurrence for all of them, in particular those just starting out. I feel that the mental and emotional health of those first getting into the industry, and even veterans, is grossly overlooked.

The idea was was to get that basic interface together and a very simple API communicating with it. Simple because as most developers would not use that website often even if it looked amazing and worked perfectly. I wanted to create an NPM CLI tool that would allow developers to pull up an encouraging phrase, tip for keeping Impostor Syndrome in check and reminders of how far they've come in their personal growth.

Unfortunately, I was working with an unscrupulous deadline, the wrong framework for the job, scrapped it, leaving me with four days to complete it, and then received clarification of new deliverables 24 hours to deadline. It made the application in it's current state somewhat inefficacious to its purpose and and suffocated the most unique and exciting features planned. It taught me a lot about clarifying deliverables with clients and being more wary of working with clients who can't clarify what they want from you.



## User Stories

-  As a user, I want to be able to sign in and see my symptoms
- As a developer, I will use nested routes and specific controller actions to create user-owned data
1.  As a user, I want to be able to find choose symptoms from a dropdown
1.  As a developer, I will make the ux smooth and minimal
1.  As a developer, I will implement CRUD functionality to allow the user to create symptoms
2. As a user I want to be able to see all users solutions, with or without signing in
